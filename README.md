# Chat App
This webapp uses React for frontend and nodeJS for backend.
## To start:

### Step 1
Clone the repository and open 3 terminal windows/tabs at the folder

### Step 2
In the first terminal 
`cd backend`
`npm install`

In the other 2 terminals
`cd client`
`npm install`

If nodeJS throws peer deps error then add use
`npm install -- legacy-peer-deps`

### Step 3
Now in all 3 terminals type (in the backend terminal first and then the other two)
`npm start`
to start the server
If nodeJS says port is in use type `y` to allow it to use a different one

In the browser go to
[http://localhost:3006/](http://localhost:3006/) to chat as user 1
[http://localhost:3007/](http://localhost:3007/) to chat as user 2
